# ThAmCo-WebApps-ICA
ThAmCo Events Element One | CIS2021-N | Web Apps and Services | Year 2 Semester 1
This is a project from my second year of iniversity and was the first significant attempt at a web application.
This was meant to be a web based events management system that had locations, staff and food all in one place.
The food section of the service being unimplemented due to time constraints and issues on the Universities end of the system which we needed to intergrate with.
